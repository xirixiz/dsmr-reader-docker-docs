# Introduction

Welcome to the home of the DSMR Reader Docker Docs! It is our goal to ensure that all of our images are properly documented with all of the relevant information, in order to help our users get started. In addition to individual set up guides for each image, there is also general information, and best practices, pertaining to running the DSMR Reader Docker container.
